# Face Recognition using CNNü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

face recognition system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and recognize faces in real-time.

### Code Requirements

- Opencv(`pip install opencv-python`)
- Tkinter(`pip install tk`)
- Pillow(`pip install pillow`)
- TensorFlow(`pip install tensorflow`)
- Keras(`pip install keras`)
- NumPy(`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib(`pip install matplotlib`)

### What steps you have to follow??
- Download my Repository 
- Create a `dataset` folder in a project.
- Open a `main_gui.py` and change the all paths with your system path.
- Run `main_gui.py`.

### Project Structure

- After run you need to give your face data to system so enter your ID and name in box than click on `Take Images` button.
- It will collect images of your faces, it save a images in `dataset` folder.
- After that we need to train a model(for train a model click on `Train Model` button.
- It will take 5-10 minutes for training(for 10 person data).
- After training click on `Face Recognition`, to identify users in real-time.

### Notes
- It will require high processing power(I have 16 GB RAM).
- Noisy image can reduce the accuracy, so quality of images should be good.
